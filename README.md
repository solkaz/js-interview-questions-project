# JS Interview Questions framework

## Features

- Write JavaScript, get type-checked with TypeScript.
  - Easy to remove TypeScript if it's not desired.
  - Already written in JavaScript; no time is spent converting TypeScript code
- Uses Jest to run tests.

## Why

I have to interview again, and that means showing potential employers that I am proficient with JavaScript. I've had a few coding assignments that used online editors (Hackerrank, Codility) that I never felt was conducive to testing (e.g. not allowing for arbitrary test cases), and I like my own programming environment. Thus I made this as a quick project to use if I have a coding assessment on one of those platforms.

## Installation

Clone this repository, then use Yarn to install dependencies.

```sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:solkaz/js-interview-questions-project.git your-company-interview
cd your-company-interview
